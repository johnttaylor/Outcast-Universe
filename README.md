# Outcast-Universe
Live Foreign Outcast universe (see www.integerfox.com/outcast for what the heck is an Outcast universe)

This repository contains Outcast 'top' files.  A top file is tar/zip file of an Outcast published package's 
top/ directory. The top file contains all of the essential information of package. Top files for example 
contain the package's version info, dependencies, package summary, etc.

What this means is the contained files are meaningless unless you are using Outcast to manage and 
publish packages.
